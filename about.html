                    <h3>My Story</h3>
                    <div class="pdecor" style="background-image: url(../texture/me.png)"></div> 
                    
                    <p>Back in primary school, one of my friends told me that I should play with a game called Minecraft. He said that this game meant for me. But I answered that I would never play that silly game. Additionally, at that time, I wasn't a big computer enthusiast. Even my IT teacher said that I should have practiced at home.</p>
                    
                    <p>Well, a year later when I first tried the game at one of my relatives on an Xbox, I immediately got hooked up. That old school 8-bit feel of the game and it's calming music just fascinated me. I enjoyed the freedom of constructing particularistic structures so much.</p>

                    <p>After this experience, I started watching gameplay videos on YouTube and later I got the pocket edition from one of my classmates. It was a very simplified version back then, but I was so happy about it. On my birthday, I finally got my hands on the Xbox edition which I played a lot with my younger brother. At the end of summer 2014,  I eventually bought the pc edition. </p>
                    
                    <p>I always built complex redstone circuits and systems. But how did I get into command blocks? Well, at first I thought that they were part of a mod. (Very stupid, I know!) But when I realized the fact that I can obtain one with a "give" command, the limits of the game suddenly got wiped out for me, and the coding fun began.</p>
                    
                    <p>The first more advanced command I came across, was a skyblock in only one command. I thought that it was black magic and I would never be able to create stuff like that. But hey, after some time, I gained the skills to recreate one of my largest redstone creation (a fully functional Tamagotchi) with only one command block.</p>
                    
                    <p>I always dreamed about a YouTube channel where I can share my inventions. However, my perfectionism didn't let me do it for many years. I was desired to make professional videos, so I mastered After Effects and Premiere Pro.</p>
                    
                    <p>I can only say thank you to Minecraft. My journey wouldn't have been the way it is now without it. This game helped me to improve the way I think from many approaches. I would call it rather a tool to express my creativity than a simple game. Also, thanks to it, I got introduced to from the world of game development to 3D modeling. With a rough start, I become a computer expert.</p>
