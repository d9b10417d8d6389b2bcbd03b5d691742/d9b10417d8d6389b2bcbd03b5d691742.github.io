                    <!--<p>Back in primary school, one of my friends told me that I should play with a game called Minecraft. He said that this game was for me. (Probably because I have a passionate circuit building spirit...) But I answered: "I will never play with that stupid game. And it has such low-quality graphics that ruin your eyes". At that time, I wasn't a big computer fan. Even my IT teacher said that I should have practiced at home.</p>
                    
                    <p>About a year later, when I visited one of my relatives, we sat down to play something on an Xbox. And I said that I wanna try to that game as they had it. So, this was the first time I played that game. And I really enjoyed it I just liked the style and the feeling of the game, even if I had difficulties to move around.</p>

                    <p>From that time I started watching gameplay videos on YouTube. And later I got the pocket edition from one of my classmates. It was a very basic version back then. On my birthday, I got the Xbox edition. We played with my brother a lot. In 2014 at the end of summer I finally got the pc edition. I remember I first built a stone house on a redstone map. My first biggest redstone build is on that map, a fully functional Tamagotchi. </p>
                    
                    <p>But how did I get into command blocks? Well... at first I thought that they were added by a mod. But, when I realized that I can easily get one with the "give" command, I started to do easy time setting mechanics on that redstone map.</p>
                    
                    <p>The first "advanced" command I came across at that time was a skyblock in only one command. I thought that it was magic I would never be able to do stuff like that. But hey, after some time I got into some cool cmd projects and I decided to make a Tamagotchi with only command blocks in 1.8 with the same functionalities as the first redstone version.</p>
                    
                    <p>I always wanted to make a Minecraft youtube channel, and I wanted to do it alone, without any help. So I learned about basic video editing and everything to do that. But I didn't stop there. I wanted to make professional videos, so I learned after effects and premiere pro. And also 3d animation and CGI. Since then I also learned many different programming languages, game development, and web development. (I also learned to write simple computer viruses to troll my friends). I even started to put together simple loops in fl studio to make music for my games (but you don't want to hear them).</p>-->
